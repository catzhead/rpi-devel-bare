# Bare metal Raspberry
This repository contains basic trial & error examples to execute some low-level stuff on the Raspberry Pi.

Only 32-bit compilation is used, relying on the compiler [recommended](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md) for the compilation of the raspberry kernel.

If you need a docker container with everything ready, here is [one](https://github.com/catzhead/rpi-devel-docker).
